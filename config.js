    footer: "If you’ve made it till here, thank you so much for reading. This was months in the making, and it took me a while to learn how to put together a story like this. I have Sid, Kiran and Joshua to thank for clearing a million of my doubts. A big thanks to Sahil and the rest of my lovelies for their thoughts on all the drafts. Baby brother helped me get all these pictures. Something about standing on giant shoulders, and all that.<br><br>Gathering data for a memory project like this is tricky, because the data itself can be subjective. But Notion timestamps and Spotify histories saved my butt here. I was able to retrace my listening activity, and couple it with the rest of my memory. <a href='https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20140417-why-does-music-evoke-memories' target='_blank'>This</a> (and also <a href='https://time.com/6167197/psychology-behind-remembering-music/' target='_blank'>this</a>) should loosely explain why music is such a good mnemonic tool.<br><br>There were so many more tracks that didn’t make the cut but did remind me of places and people. I promise you, my Spotify voyages go further than what I've featured here. Hit me up and we could share some music :)<br><br>I found this to be a fascinating way to remember life, and I hope you did too.",

I really wished the city was more pedestrian, planned, and well equipped with public transport. But for now, I just hope to meet my friends before they go to bed. ",

            description: "May is turning out to be a very exciting month. I’ve hit a new vein of inspiration after ages. I’m toying with the idea of making a small pivot in my career, and the more I turn it around, the more capable I feel. Credit to all the amazing people I found on my Twitter timeline. I have so many ideas that I want to plant and grow. Creative juices are at a high and I’m letting doubt take the backseat a little more often. ",

            description: "I’m veering into Koramangala, when I catch myself thinking of it as ‘my neighbourhood’. I wonder if I should avoid such language, but I’m learning to let me be. And it feels radical. No, really. If it sounds romantic, that’s because it is. It’s an act of kindness and it feels like a deceptively simple practice. I move, I decide, I’m responsible, I’m accountable, I’m scared and I’m sorry, but I’m not, I’m learning, I’m grateful, <em>I’m</em> letting me have it and I love it. ",

            description: "I took a trip to Mumbai, Goa and then Ooty, a week or two later. I love the feeling of displacement that comes with travelling, the one that makes you feel like a speck. I’m plenty thankful for the trip to Ahmedabad earlier in the year, but this was triple the humble juice dosage. My barber decided that wasn’t enough humble, so he worked his magic. Joke’s on him, Diwali is done and I’ve clicked my annual profile picture. I feel 5 years have passed in one. I don’t know how time works but I’m glad it does. ",
