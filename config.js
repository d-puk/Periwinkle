I have Sid, Kiran and Joshua to thank for clearing a million of my doubts. A big thanks to Sahil and the rest of my lovelies for their thoughts on all the drafts. Baby brother helped me get all these pictures. Something about standing on giant shoulders, and all that.<br><br>Gathering data for a memory project like this is tricky, because the data itself can be subjective. But Notion timestamps and Spotify histories saved my butt here. I was able to retrace my listening, and couple it with the rest of my memory.<br><br>There were so many more tracks that didn’t make the cut but did remind me of places and people. I promise you, my Spotify voyages go far. Link with me and we could share some music :)<br><br>I found this to be a fascinating way to remember life, and I hope you did too.",

I really wished the city was more pedestrian, planned, and well equipped with public transport. But for now, I just hoped to meet my friends before they went to bed. ",

            description: "May was turning out to be a very exciting month. I just hit a new vein of inspiration after ages. I was toying with the idea of making some career adjustments, and the more I weighed it, the more solid it felt. Credit to all the amazing people, work and communities I found on my Twitter timeline. I had so many ideas to plant and grow. Creative juices were at an all time high and I was letting doubt take the backseat a little more often. This is now my solarpunk era, and Common is on the soundtrack.",

            description: "I was veering into Koramangala, when I caught myself thinking of it as ‘my neighbourhood’. I wondered if I should avoid such language, but I was learning to let me be. And it felt radical. No, really. If it sounds romantic, that’s because it is. It’s an act of kindness and it’s amazing how deceptively simple the practice is. So is using my ego, stating my feelings, stating my needs, listening to my body and drawing my lines. The beat on this track just let me have it. I'm sorry but I'm not, I’m learning, I’m accountable, I’m reconnecting, I’m grateful for everything, I’m letting me have it and I love it. ",

            description: "Took a trip to Mumbai, then Goa. Also Ooty, a week or two later. I love the feeling of displacement that comes with travelling, the one that makes you feel like a speck. I was plenty thankful for the trip to Ahmedabad earlier in the year, but this was triple the humble juice dosage. My barber decided that wasn’t enough humble, so he worked his magic. Joke’s on him, Diwali is done and I got the pics I needed. I was heading into the underpass that opens into my layout. I felt five years in one. I don’t know how time works but I’m glad it does. ",
